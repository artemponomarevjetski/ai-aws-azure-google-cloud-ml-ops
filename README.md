This repository contains various resources and code related to DevOps, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Machine Learning pipelines. It covers a wide range of topics and technologies. Below are some key sections and their descriptions:

## "Create gRPC app using TensorFlow Machine Learning on the Amazon Deep Learning AMI Consuming the Model Served by TensorFlow Serving":

This section provides instructions on how to create a gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) application that utilizes TensorFlow Machine Learning. The application is designed to run on the Amazon Deep Learning AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and consumes models served by TensorFlow Serving. You can find the detailed guide and code in the [gRPC_Consuming_theModelServed_by_TensorFlow_Serving.ipynb](https://github.com/artemponomarevjetski/artemp-portfolio-complete-ml-ops-pipeline/blob/main/gRPC_Consuming_theModelServed_by_TensorFlow_Serving..ipynb) file.

## "Rekognition. Text analysis":

This section focuses on Amazon Rekognition, a deep learning-based service for image and video analysis. It specifically covers the text analysis capabilities of Amazon Rekognition. Detailed content and code related to this topic may be available in the repository.

## "A bunch of items on Azure and AWS":

This section includes a collection of resources, code samples, and configurations related to Azure and AWS (Amazon Web Services). It covers various aspects of these cloud platforms, providing insights and practical information for working with them.
