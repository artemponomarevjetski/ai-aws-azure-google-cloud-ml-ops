TensorFlow Serving models are consumed by clients. Client code needs to make a connection to the server and communicate using protocol buffers. Google's gRPC remote procedure call library provides the ability to connect and make calls to the server. After establishing a connection, you make a call by preparing the input for model prediction and serializing it in the request. The serialized prediction output is returned by the server.
