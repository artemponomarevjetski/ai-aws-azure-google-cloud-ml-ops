TensorFlow Serving models are consumed by clients. Client code needs to make a connection to the server and communicate using protocol buffers. Google's gRPC remote procedure call library provides the ability to connect and make calls to the server. After establishing a connection, you make a call by preparing the input for model prediction and serializing it in the request. The serialized prediction output is returned by the server.

2. Rekognition. Text analysis.

3. A bunch of items on Azure and AWS. For description of these exercises, see my numerous posts on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/artemponomarevpolycephalicturingmachinethatneverhalts/
